_Stopped at day 10 because things are just too difficult for this pea brain._

[Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/), done in [Golang](https://go.dev/).

## Folder structure

1. Input files are expected to be in the `input/` folder, as text file. E.g., `input/01.txt`.
1. Challenges are organized into folders, with the `{day}-{part}` format.
1. `NG.txt` means that the solution in the folder does not work.
